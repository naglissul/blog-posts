What's the point?

now there's no point (except for the human factor)
point will appear later


Today, just about 8 hours ago I finished writing my final exam for Electromagnetism. And also touched this idea while writing Pirmasis Sniegas

still needs some kind of Human purpose
Yeah, that's right. I'm studying Software Engineering
but still decided to take one of the most difficult Physics courses in Radboud University. You might ask why. Idk :D
I haven't fully figured out the purpose yet. I guess that just doesnt have a purpose yet. Sometimes I think it is ok to do something
that at the time looks meaningless, cuz sooner or later the meaning will be uncovered. And that's gonna be really helpful - this thinking forward
before there's a need to do it. 

More about this idea you can later read in my future book Pirmasis sniegas (sorry, but for now it's only in Lithuanian - maybe I wil write a short summary in English)
