Functions:

- injective – one-to-one, hence f(x<sub>1</sub>) = f(x<sub>2</sub>) implies x<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>
- surjective – onto, visi y turi bent vieną x
- bijective – injective surjective

Relations:

- Transitive
- Symmetric
- Reflective

## Group (follows group theory)

5-polynomial proof

Group (G, \*) is a nonempty set G together with binary operation ‘\*’ on G such that:

- **CLOSURE**: a\*b is a uniquely defined element of G.
- **ASSOCIATIVITY**: a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c.
- **IDENTITY**: ∃e ∈ G: e*a = a and a*e = a, ∀a ∈ G.
- **INVERSE ELEMENT**: For each a ∈ G, ∃a<sup>-1</sup> ∈ G: a<sup>-1</sup>*a = e and a*a<sup>-1</sup> = e.
- Commutative group (Abelian group): a*b = b*a.

## Ring

Ring (R, +, _) is a set R, together with two operations (+, _) which has the following properties:

- (R, +) is an **ABELIAN GROUP.**
- (R, \*) has **CLOSURE** and **ASSOCIATIVITY.**
- **DISTRIBUTIVITY**: a*(b+c) = (a*b)+(a*c) and (a+b)*c = (a*c)+(b*c)
- Commutative ring: (R, \*) has commutativity.

## Field

Field extensions, Galois field, arithmetic, getting ready for error correction

Field (F, +, _) is a set F together with two operations + and _, which has the following properties:

- (F, +, \*) is a **COMMUTATIVE RING**
- (F, \*) has **INDENTITY**
- (F, \*) has **INVERSE**

In other words – field axioms:

- **CLOSURE** under \* and +
- **ASSOCIATIVITY** under \* and +
- **COMMUTATIVITY** under \* and +
- **INVERSES** of \* and +
- **IDENTITIES** of \* and +
- **DISTRIBUTIVITY** of \* over +
