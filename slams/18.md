# Part 5. Second chapter: The beetles are real

_English version of "5 dalis. Antras skyrius: Vabalai yra tikri"_

The first rule – never go to sleep with the lights off. There has to be some kind of light, let’s say a small
lamp, sending a light ray through a door crack from the farthest corner of the other room, where someone
is still awake. Because otherwise, black beetles start crawling on the walls even in reality, therefore even
more easily penetrating into a dream.
The second rule – never go back home. That never works, only calls out even more black beetles. You
cannot run from them like that. You cannot go to some kind of known place, or, basically, where are some
known people, because there black beetles start to crawl onto them. The best is to give up for the first
feeling, for what needs to be done and don’t try to rebel. Just do everything in the way it seems the most
normal. And if there are too many black beetles around you, you cannot run from them. Running
somewhere, thinking about it, you won’t get anything good in return. When there are too many black beetles
around you, you cannot do anything about it. You only can wake up. But I still don’t know how to do it.
Therefore I wake up only being eaten by black beetles, being everywhere. And the pain is real.

The beetles are real.
